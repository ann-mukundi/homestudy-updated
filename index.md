# Overview

At Andela, we focus on teaching the things that are difficult for
people to learn on their own. If you're just getting started though, there's a
wealth of resources scattered around the web to help you out. We've tried to
cherry-pick the best of those resources and organize them into distinct
learning paths that will help you get started on achieving your goals.

Each resource has an estimated amount of time it should take you if you have
zero prior knowledge on the topic. We make suggestions of how much time to
spend on each section. Try and achieve the learning objectives in the suggested
time frame, then move on. You can always come back and watch the section again.

Some of the resources have quizzes/badges attached. Even if you're already familiar with a topic, you might learn something from taking the quiz -- we do.

These paths are designed around breadth over depth. We feel it's important to
get a solid foundation in the broad set of fundamentals within each path before
diving deeper into a specific area. Try to read and watch as much as possible.

# Progression

The Andela progression is designed to be immersive. It consists of a hybrid of self-sufficient training and heavy team interactions and mentorship. Your experience level DOES NOT MATTER. Your goal should be to learn to think like a programmer, not learn a specific language. Choose one you're passionate about as the lens through which you will learn, and everything else will fall into place. We promise.
