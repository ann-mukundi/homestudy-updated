            <h1>Web Development</h1>

<p>The first version of the training we tried to assemble all of the best resources
for learning to build simple web applications with Javascript. With our students, we noticed
that the bootcamp wasn&#39;t preparing them as well as it could have. We were
missing a big opportunity. Our students expressed that the training went for
breadth over depth. Rather than honing in on javascript, the meat of our curriculum,
a lot of time was spent on HTML and CSS which is an important but secondary
piece.</p>

<p>We strongly believe that learning should have context, and you should know what
your goals are.  Each section will address which learning objectives it will
cover, and at the beginning we expect all of you to check out the Javascript
assesment so you know what you&#39;ll be expected to do at the end of bootcamp.  There&#39;s an
infinite amount of things you could spend your time learning, part of the value
of the bootcamp is that we can narrow the scope to only the most essential.  If
you can achieve fluency in the basic and homestudy topics, we believe you&#39;ll flourish at
Andela.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>To complete these units, you will need a 
<a href="http://www.codeschool.com/enrollments/dnFtaXFMbXROSVVqT3N1bngwWnBRUjhGc2k1Z1dEOW52cFJvZEMzRUZvRT0tLWpvUElMODBvdFhiZlA4MjE2Mlc2c1E9PQ==">CodeSchool</a>
account. You also will need a
<a href="http://codeacademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a> account which is free.</p>

<p>You should also have a NodeJS Development environment setup. There are lots of
guides for that on the internet and depending on your OS and setup, it&#39;s a bit
of a process. You could always use <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Download Node</a>.</p>

<p>Note to students accepted into the Andela. We will provide you with an
account to treehouse and codeschool, feel free to use your own to get started,
but we cover those costs for the duration of the fellowship.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>One of the challenges in learning how to code is that you probably don&#39;t even
know what you&#39;re supposed to learn. When creating this prework, we had 4 goals
in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full Stack</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ll present the full stack of technologies required to build a webapp from
  the ground up. We don&#39;t care if you use Jade or Markdown. The web is built on HTML
  and everyone should learn it. Whether NoSQL or SQL, understanding the
  fundamentals of schema design and SQL is crucial. Students shouldn&#39;t shy away
  from depth. How can you be a web developer without a proficiency in these
  skills?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Linear Progression</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The material is presented in order, going from web basics and computer
  basics, to markup, to styling, to version control, to programming, and then
  to databases and web frameworks. You learn the basics of code through Javascript
  and then finally move to NodeJS that builds upon the rest. Thus you start at
  the lowest level, the literal HTML the browser renders, and progress up
  through levels of abstraction until you finally get to the kitchen sink that
  is the MEAN Stack. As a beginner, don&#39;t try to learn Node without
  knowing basic HTML/CSS and Javascript. It&#39;s a disservice to your education.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Curated Resources</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There is such a plethora of amazing content on learning to code. We liked the
  consistency of going to a few sources that all shared common interfaces and
  learning patterns, like videos and interactive portions. So this isn&#39;t a
  complete list of all the resources, but more a curated list of what we think
  works well together (with lots of feedback from current fellows). We would love it if
  you submitted a github issue with more materials you&#39;ve enjoyed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Language Agnosticism</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, programming is about abstractions and expressions. The mechanics
  of code are universal and exist in all modern languages, like python, ruby,
  and javascript. We teach Javascript because we love it. Thinking your language
  choice, especially as a beginner, matters, is like thinking that you can only
  write poetry in English and not in Spanish. Obviously the beauty of poetry is
  in rhyme and meter, in metaphor and simile, in cadence and rhythm, not in the
  king&#39;s English. Why should code be any different? At Andela, you&#39;re
  learning how to think, how to break problems down, how to express yourself,
  how to abstract ideas, and how to work together. We just learn that through
  Javascript  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>The goal of this tutorial is to be able to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment</li>
<li>Understand where programming skills fit into the &quot;web&quot;</li>

<li>Develop a level of comfort with the most common ruby patterns in web development</li>
<li>Understand the basics of version control and why it is used</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of HTML including forms</li>
<li>Through Rails you should learn the following:

<ul>
<li>RESTful interfaces</li>
<li>HTTP</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Where ruby fits in the web development stack</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Develop a comfort with basic SQL queries</li>

<h2>The Command Line</h2>

<p><em>Min 2hr Max 6hr</em></p>

<p>The command line is your home base. It&#39;s probably one of the most important
differences between a consumer of a computer, and a user. Many developers have
all sorts of crazy short cut keys set up so that they can use their computer
solely from the command line without ever having to reach for the mouse. It&#39;s
vitaly important that you start thinking like a developer, rather than a
consumer. Getting comfortable with the command line is the first step. If you
feel like you&#39;re spending too much time on this section, and you&#39;ve
accomplished the learning objectives, move on.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Navigate a file structure</li>
<li>Use your terminal to type commands</li>
<li>Make files and directories from the command line</li>
<li>Open files from the command line</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations-2" title="Console Foundation Treehouse Link">Console Foundations</a> is a great video series by Treehouse that
covers lots of Bash Stuff. Some of it is more advanced, so we only included a
few sections we feel are crucial. But feel free to skip around. The stuff about
Environment Variables and PATHS is important. But it&#39;s short and worth going
through at least once.</p>

<h4>WAT?</h4>

<p>What is version control?!</p>

<p>Github&#39;s &quot;About Version Control&quot; Version control is a system that records
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific
versions later. Even though the examples in this book show software source code
as the files under version control, in reality any type of file on a computer
can be placed under version control.</p>

<h2>Javascript</h2>

<p><em>Min 20Hr Max 40Hr</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My conscience won’t let me call Javascript a computer language. That would imply
that the language works primarily on the computer’s terms. That the language
is designed to accomodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore,
we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s
locale. It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.</p>

<p>But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that
language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms
to express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the
computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!</p>

<p>We can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is coderspeak.
It is the language of our thoughts.</p>

<p><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">eloquent javascript</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Programming allows you to automate common, repetitive tasks on the computer.
Developers use programming languages to write software, the software you
interact with every day. From your alarm clock to your computer; from the web to
the satellites orbiting our planet, software powers all of it.</p>

<p>Javascript is a programming language that we can use to do any task that needs to be
run in the browser. Now it can be used to automate anything.
For example, something that is really irritating is a cluttered
&quot;Downloads&quot; folder on your Mac. We could write a program that moves a file to a
new folder, based on it&#39;s file extension, whenever we download something. A
&quot;scripting-language&quot; would be best suited for this task.</p>

<p>Javascript is one of the most popular languages to create web applications. A web
framework is a tool that makes developing for the web relatively simple. Some popular web frameworks for Javascript are Express.js and AngularJS. Express is considered as a server side framework as it
will be run on an actual web server.</p>

<h1>Training &amp; Fellowship</h1>

<p>There are many mediums, through which one can deliver applications. You can
have Desktop Applications, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system">Embedded Applications</a> and Web Applications to name a
few. At Andela we focus on building Web Applications.</p>

<p>In previous sections you&#39;ve built a static sites using HTML and CSS. You used
markup languages to tell the browser how to render the content you were
displaying. In order to have the ability to interact with your users and store
the information they give you, we&#39;ll need to add more technologies to our
toolbelt. These technologies are usually referred to as your &quot;Stack.&quot;</p>

<p>A stack usually includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operating System: a collection of software that manages computer hardware
resources and provides common services for computer programs e.g. <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a></li>
<li>Web Server: Software that helps deliver web content to a client e.g.
<a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a></li>
<li>Database: An organized collection of data. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for example.</li>
<li>Programming Language, like <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a></li>
<li>A Web Framework like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ve already covered the basics of your operating system and done a brief
intro to Ruby. Now we will do a short intro to the language that is used by
most of the databases used industry-wide, SQL.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p><em>Min 4hr Max 10hr</em></p>

<p>In order for a web application to be useful it needs to store data, access that
data and organize the data. This is the job of a database. Typically web apps
respond to user input and do one of four things, create, read, update, or
delete data in a database. Javascript serves as a kind of intermediary between the
user and the database and it can communicate with a database in its native
language, which for our purposes is MongoDB.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Understand what a database is used for</li>
<li>Be able to create, read, update and delete data</li>
<li>Understand that there are 2 types of DB</li>
<li>Understand how you can relate two tables in a database (ex. products and categories)</li>
<li>Be able to write a simple SQL join between two tables</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations">Treehouse SQL Course</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations</a></p>

<p>The Treehouse SQL course is comprehensive and easy to follow. It uses MySQL,
which is a powerful database server that we don&#39;t really use at Andela for
teaching purposes, but learning how to install it and use its GUI isn&#39;t a waste
of time. So feel free to gloss over the MySQL setup / specific stuff, but it&#39;s
useful.</p>

<h3><a href="http://try.mongodb.org/">Try MongoDB</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://try.mongodb.org/">http://try.mongodb.org/</a></p>

<p>A self guided tour of the mongoDB shell. It&#39;s
short and intense, but try to get through the entire thing.</p>

<h2>NodeJS</h2>

<p><em>Min 8hr Max 16hr</em></p>

<p>To build a Node application you&#39;ll need to be able to save and retrieve data
from a database using SQL or NoSQL, send HTML and CSS back to the browser, navigate your
computer using the command line, and use git to version control your source
code. Because Node requires so many skills at once, we don&#39;t want the focus of
the bootcamp to be Rails, but rather getting introduced to the concepts
necessary to build modern web applications. Hopefully the first time we talk
about Node in the classroom, it won&#39;t be the first time you&#39;ve heard the terms
controller or route, but it&#39;s also not the goal to master Node before you get
here. With that in mind, feel free to spend as much time as you&#39;d like
exploring Node through the following tutorials. However, we&#39;re going to cover
all of this in depth during the semester so it&#39;s probably best to use these
turorials as a guide for the component skills you&#39;ll need to build web
applications. For example, how much Javascript do I need to know? Can be answered by
building a Node application and seeing how much Javascript you need to know.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Understand request and response flow</li>
<li>The MVC Pattern</li>
<li>Routes and URLs</li>
<li>The Params Object</li>
</ol>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>First, we&#39;d love to thank all the amazing people who created these source
materials. Most of it is from CodeSchool and Treehouse, with a bit from Zed
Shaw, and some from the people at Skillcrush. Obviously there are a lot more
resources out there for learning these topics. This guide is just my current
preferences and tries to put them in a linear fashion so skills can build upon
each other. Hope it helps someone. The biggest acknowledgement goes to the Flatiron School that created this idea.</p>
