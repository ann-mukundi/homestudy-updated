Programming allows you to automate common, repetitive tasks on the computer.
Developers use programming languages to write software, the software you
interact with every day. From your alarm clock to your computer; from the web to
the satellites orbiting our planet, software powers all of it.

Javascript is a programming language that we can use to do any task that needs to be
run in the browser. Now it can be used to automate anything.
For example, something that is really irritating is a cluttered
"Downloads" folder on your Mac. We could write a program that moves a file to a
new folder, based on it's file extension, whenever we download something. A
"scripting-language" would be best suited for this task.

Javascript is one of the most popular languages to create web applications. A web
framework is a tool that makes developing for the web relatively simple. Some popular web frameworks for Javascript are Express.js and AngularJS. Express is considered as a server side framework as it
will be run on an actual web server.

We think the CodeAcademy Javascript Track is a comprehensive and engaging way to
cover the fundementals of the Javascript Langauge. Do it all. The super super
important parts are:

  * [Getting Started](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/4fa836e5996b00000302064a/resume?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661)
  * [Functions Functions Everwhere](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/4ff5f0db990be7000304059a/resume?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661)
