## Databases
*Min 4hr Max 10hr*

In order for a web application to be useful it needs to store data, access that
data and organize the data. This is the job of a database. Typically web apps
respond to user input and do one of four things, create, read, update, or
delete data in a database. Javascript serves as a kind of intermediary between the
user and the database and it can communicate with a database in its native
language, which for our purposes is MongoDB.

### Learning Objectives
  1. Understand what a database is used for
  2. Be able to create, read, update and delete data
  3. Understand that there are 2 types of DB
  4. Understand how you can relate two tables in a database (ex. products and categories)
  5. Be able to write a simple SQL join between two tables

The Treehouse SQL course is comprehensive and easy to follow. It uses MySQL,
which is a powerful database server that we don't really use at Andela for
teaching purposes, but learning how to install it and use its GUI isn't a waste
of time. So feel free to gloss over the MySQL setup / specific stuff, but it's
useful.

A self guided tour of the mongoDB shell. It's
short and intense, but try to get through the entire thing.
