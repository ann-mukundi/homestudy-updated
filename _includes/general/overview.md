# Overview

In this document you're going to find a ton of reading, videos, and quizzes
that Andela candidates complete before their fellowship even begins. We thought
we'd open source this material.

Below we have listed out a few of the paths you can go down. Each one starts 
from nothing and takes you through the steps to jumpstart your learning.

Each resource has an estimated amount of time it should take you if you have
zero prior knowledge on the topic. If you are coming to this with absolutely no
experience then we estimate this work will take you between 80 - 100 hours to
complete. If you are a rockstar then it shouldn't take more than 20 hours.

We make suggestions of how much time to spend on each section. Try and achieve
the learning objectives in the suggested timeframe, then move on. You can
always come back and watch the section again.

If you are familiar with the topic, we highly suggest trying to take the quiz
or challenge first. If you pass easily and collect the badge, great, move on.
That being said, even we found ourselves learning new things during this
assessment. So maybe try to watch the videos on the topics with which you are
most unfamiliar.

In terms of reading and watching videos, feel free to skip through - go for
overall coverage as opposed to depth. Try to read and watch as much as possible
and then try to take the quiz. Be quick, and then do a 2nd round of reading and
watching.

We strongly believe that learning should have context, and you should know what
your goals are. Each section will list a set of Learning Objectives for you to
strive for. There's an infinite amount of things you could spend your time
learning. Part of the value of the prework is that we can narrow the scope to
only the most essential. If you can achieve some level of comfort in the
following topics we believe you'll flourish at Andela.

## Why Share It?

You might be wondering why we would share our curriculum if we are so selective in the first place. 
First, we honestly do not think that going through this
content alone will make anyone a developer. That's like saying that knowing
how to hammer a nail means you can build a house. Sure, you've got the gestures
and mechanics down, maybe, but you don't know the first thing about building.
There is just so much more to being a developer than the syntax of how to define
a method or iterate over an array. We don't focus on content at Andela. We focus on learning to love code.
