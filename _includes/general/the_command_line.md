## The Command Line 
*Min 2hr Max 6hr*

The command line is your home base. It's probably one of the most important
differences between a consumer of a computer, and a user. Many developers have
all sorts of crazy short cut keys set up so that they can use their computer
solely from the command line without ever having to reach for the mouse. It's
vitaly important that you start thinking like a developer, rather than a
consumer. Getting comfortable with the command line is the first step. If you
feel like you're spending too much time on this section, and you've
accomplished the learning objectives, move on.

### Learning Objectives

  1. Navigate a file structure
  2. Use your terminal to type commands
  3. Make files and directories from the command line

[Console Foundations](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations-2
"Console Foundation Treehouse Link") is a great video series by Treehouse that
covers lots of Bash Stuff. Some of it is more advanced, so we only included a
few sections we feel are crucial. But feel free to skip around. The stuff about
Environment Variables and PATHS is important. But it's short and worth going
through at least once.

### Some Bonus Material

The following are great resources, they just are a bit advanced and longer. We
highly recommend you putting in the time to read and go through these examples,
but don't worry if they are confusing. Do your best, always.

The venerable [Zed Shaw](http://programming-motherfucker.com/ "Programming

resource, but it's still pretty good.
