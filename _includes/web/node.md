## NodeJS
*Min 8hr Max 16hr*

To build a Node application you'll need to be able to save and retrieve data
from a database using SQL or NoSQL, send HTML and CSS back to the browser, navigate your
computer using the command line, and use git to version control your source
code. Because Node requires so many skills at once, we don't want the focus of
the bootcamp to be Rails, but rather getting introduced to the concepts
necessary to build modern web applications. Hopefully the first time we talk
about Node in the classroom, it won't be the first time you've heard the terms
controller or route, but it's also not the goal to master Node before you get
here. With that in mind, feel free to spend as much time as you'd like
exploring Node through the following tutorials. However, we're going to cover
all of this in depth during the semester so it's probably best to use these
turorials as a guide for the component skills you'll need to build web
applications. For example, how much Javascript do I need to know? Can be answered by
building a Node application and seeing how much Javascript you need to know.

NodeJS, the new server side cool kid on the block. That's right, learning Node will make you way cooler than most of your developer friends. No offense ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
