Aspiring Andelans can describe the basic concepts of data structures, the most common data structures (linear data structures and hash tables) and of those, how to identify the most efficient structure to use in a given situation.

----------

### **Demonstrating knowledge of data structures **
A. **  When designing a solution for a programming problem **
- I use the data structures that are most efficient for the needs of the problem

B. **  When using data structures that are already implemented in a programming language or framework **
-  I gain an understanding of how efficient the data structures are

----------

### **What do I need to believe about data structures:?**
1. The most efficient algorithms are built on most appropriate data structures for the problem
