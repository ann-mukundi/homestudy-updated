----------

### ** Implementing Object Oriented Programming**
A. **  When I am faced with a data modeling problem **
- I attempt to identify all the objects, and each object's properties and their behaviours

B. **  When creating a class model for an object **
- I define my object's attributes as variables and behaviour as methods within my class

C. ** When working on codebase that I foresee will grow dramatically **
- I strive to ensure my code is DRY by building reusable components

D. ** When modeling data using OOP **
- I take advantage of inheritance to ensure I am reusing code as much as possible

----------

### **What do I need to believe about Object Oriented Programming:?**
1. Modeling my code in an object oriented way helps me think about problems in a structured way
2. Modeling my code in an object oriented way helps me write sustainable and reusable program components
