### **Demonstrating Growth Mindset:**

**A. When I become aware of my skill gaps **
I identify:
- WHERE I am already strong
- WHAT I need to learn to have that ability
- WHO I can talk to who is good at that
- WHERE I can find independent learning materials to support me
- HOW I can put that learning into action so that I get hands-on experience

**B. When faced with a task that is above my present skill level**
- I find the opportunities for learning and get excited about them

**C. When faced with a task that needs me to level up from my present skill level**
-  I break down the requirements and research where to get the resources needed to help level up
