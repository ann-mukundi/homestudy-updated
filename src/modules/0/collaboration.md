## **Demonstrating collaboration**

A. **  When I have a goal in mind, **

B. **  When I have a goal in mind, **
- I seek and accept diverse ideas and view the output from different lenses.

- I make myself accessible to all Andelans around the globe that may need my help

D. **  When I’m collaborating with a group: **
- I share my work frequently

- I learn about the individual motivations of each team member

E. **  When making collaboration requests to a group larger than 6 people, **
- I accompany my requests with a potential solution and context around the problem and benefits of the proposed solution.
