### ** What do I need to believe about this skill? **
1. By deeply understanding the main features of ES6 and how they are applied, I become a more effective developer.
2. Using ES6 for any new program shows that I am up to speed on the newest and latest languages out there in the world of technology.
3. Some of the changes in ES6 are just syntactic sugar, but a few will change the way Iâ€™m able to program.
4. I am always looking for the simplest way to write JavaScript. ES6 introduces further clarity into my code.
