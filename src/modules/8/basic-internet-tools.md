I. **What is the Internet?**

The Internet is a global collection of computer networks that are linked together by devices called routers and use a common set of protocols for data transmission known as TCP/IP (transmission control protocol / Internet protocol). The primary purpose of the Internet is to facilitate the sharing of information. There are many different tools used on the Internet to make this possible. Some of the more common tools include email, listservs, newsgroups, telnet, gopher, FTP, and the world wide web. Probably the most popular of all Internet tools is the world wide web.

II. **What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?**

The WWW is a collection of Internet sites that can be accessed by using a hypertext interface. Hypertext documents on the web contain links to other documents located anywhere on the web. By clicking on a link, you are immediately taken to another file or site to access relevant materials. The interesting thing about Hypertext links is that the links might take you to related material on another computer located _anywhere in the world_, rather than just to a file on your local hard drive.

**III. Basic WWW Concepts**

&gt; 1. **BROWSER** \-- A WWW browser is software on your computer that allows you to access the World Wide Web. Examples include _Netscape Navigator_ and _Microsoft Internet Explorer_. Please know that a browser cant work its magic unless you are somehow connected to the Internet. At home, that is normally accomplished by using a modem that is attached to your computer and your phone line and allows you to connect to, or dial-up, an Internet Service Provider (ISP). At work, it may be accomplished by connecting your workplaces local area network to the Internet by using a router and a high speed data line.  

&gt; 2. **HYPERTEXT AND HYPERMEDIA** \-- Hypertext is text that contains electronic links to other text. In other words, if you click on hypertext it will take you to other related material. In addition, most WWW documents contain more than just text. They may include pictures, sounds, animations, and movies. Documents with links that contain more than just text are called hypermedia.  

&gt; 3. **HTML (HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)** \-- HTML is a set of commands used to create world wide web documents. The commands allow the document creator to define the parts of the document. For example, you may have text marked as headings, paragraphs, bulleted text, footers, etc. There are also commands that let you import images, sounds, animations, and movies as well as commands that let you specify links to other documents. If you wanted to create your own web page, you would need to know HTML or be able to use a tool that can generate HTML such as Claris _HomePage_ or Adobe _PageMill_.  

&gt; 4. **URL (UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR) **\-- Links between documents are achieved by using an addressing scheme. That is, in order to link to another document or item (sound, picture, movie), it must have an address. That address is called its URL. The URL identifies the host computer name, directory path, and file name of the item. It also identifies the protocol used to locate the item such as hypertext, gopher, ftp, telnet or news. For example, the URL for the main page of the OPEN (Oregon Public Education Network) website is [http://www.open.k12.or.us][1]  

&gt; 5. **HTTP (HYPERTEXT TRANPORT PROTOCOL)** \-- HTTP is the protocol used to transfer hypertext or hypermedia documents.  

&gt; 6. **HOME PAGE** \-- A home page is usually the starting point for locating information at a WWW site. Currently, the home page for Roseburg High Schools web site is located at http://schools.rosenet.net/roseburg/rhs/  

&gt; 7. **CLIENTS AND SERVERS** \-- If a computer has a web browser installed, it is known as a client. A host computer that is capable of providing information to others is called a server. A server requires special software in order to provide web documents to others.

**IV. Using _Netscape_**

&gt; 1. To start _Netscape_ from your Macintosh, double-click the icon labeled **_Netscape._** (Note: If the icon for _Netscape_ is in Launcher then you should just single-click.) Prior to the loading of _Netscape_, the server should prompt you for a user name and password. Your user name will be the first letter of your first name followed by your last name. For example, my user name is _pboyd_. Your password will be what you turned in on the page that you signed agreeing to the acceptable use policy.![][2]
&gt; 2. Assuming that you have logged in correctly, _Netscape_ will load the default home page.  

&gt; 3. Once a web page has been loaded, you can move about the web in many ways:  

&gt;     1. Text that is underlined and in a different color indicates a link. Click on it and it will take you to more information on that topic.
&gt;     2. If you have been moving between documents and you want to go back to the previous document, press the **_Back_**_ _button from the menu bar.
&gt;     3. To go directly to a WWW site, you can type the address (URL) directly into the text box in the address bar and then press enter as in the example below:  

&gt; 
&gt; ![][3]&nbsp;
&gt; 
&gt;     4. If you find a site that is particularly good and you want to remember it for future visits, you can pull down the **_Bookmarks_** menu and select **_Add Bookmark_.**
&gt; 
&gt; ![][4]
&gt; 
&gt;     5. While browsing the web, if you want to go back to a site that you were at earlier during that same session, pull down the **_Go_** menu. A list of visited sites will be displayed. Click on the one that you want to go back to.
&gt; 4. If _Netscape_ is performing sluggishly, you can speed it up by turning off the automatic loading of images. Do this by pulling down the **_Options _ **menu, and click off **_Auto Load Images_**. This will unselect it.
&gt; 5. If it is taking a particularly long time to load a document, and you don't want to wait any longer, press the **_Stop_** button to stop loading.
&gt; 6. To save a document, pull down the **File** menu and select **_Save As_** . In the **_Folder _** Box, navigate to the folder that you wish to save the file in. In the **_Save As_** Box, enter a name for the file. In the **_Format_** Box, select **_Text_**. Click the **_Save_** button.&nbsp;![][5]
&gt; 7. To save a picture that you find on the web, put the mouse pointer on the graphic and hold down the mouse button, then select the **_Save this Image As ..._** option.
