### ** Demonstrating Nodejs Skills **
A. **  When I want to use Node.js libraries and modules, **
- I first install the latest version of Node.js.

B. **  When I want to install a Node.js module **
- I use the npm init function


C. **  When I want to provide error handling in my callback **
- I use promises through the Q module in Node.js.


D. **  When I am using streams in Node.js **
- I make sure I know what version of Node.js I am using to ensure I am working with the appropriate Node Stream API

----------

### ** What do I need to believe about skill:? **
1. Node.js is not a silver bullet for every problem - it is a framework that I can use for a particular need.
2. Using Node.js for heavy computation will annul all of its (many) advantages.
3. Node.js shines when building fast, scalable network applications.
4. With Node.js, I can handle a huge number of simultaneous connections with high throughput (thus high scalability).
