### ** Demonstrating Skill **
A. **  When I am “thinking in React,”  **
-  I first break the UI of my project into components and subcomponents.

B. **  When I have an app that renders correctly as a function of props and states,  **
- I add in data flow to allow for user interaction.

B. **  When things are getting complicated in React **
- I consider if I could break my structure into smaller pieces.

B. **  When I write a component in React **
- I check to make sure that it is only affecting one change in my program.

B. **  If I have to do a ton of work to understand what a chunk of code should do with an event **
- I need to refactor to make my component more specific.

### ** What do I need to believe about skill:? **
1. React allows me to break down my app into small pieces that can be reused, moved around, and easily understood-- like building with many lego bricks.
2. There is no such thing as building a component that it too small.
3. In React, I should be doing only one very simple thing in one place.
