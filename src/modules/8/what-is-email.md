# What is e-mail (electronic mail or email)?

E-mail (electronic mail) is the exchange of computer-stored messages by telecommunication. (Some publications spell it _email_; we prefer the currently more established spelling of _e-mail_.) E-mail messages are usually encoded in [ASCII][1] text. However, you can also send non-text files, such as graphic images and sound files, as attachments sent in [binary][2] streams. E-mail was one of the first uses of the Internet and is still the most popular use. A large percentage of the total traffic over the Internet is e-mail. E-mail can also be exchanged between [online service provider][3] users and in networks other than the Internet, both public and private.

E-mail can be distributed to lists of people as well as to individuals. A shared distribution list can be managed by using an [e-mail reflector][8]. Some mailing lists allow you to subscribe by sending a request to the mailing list administrator. A mailing list that is administered automatically is called a [list server][9].

E-mail is one of the protocols included with the Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ([TCP/IP][10]) suite of protocols. A popular protocol for sending e-mail is [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol][11] and a popular protocol for receiving it is [POP3][12]. Both Netscape and [Microsoft][13] include an e-mail utility with their [Web browsers][14].
