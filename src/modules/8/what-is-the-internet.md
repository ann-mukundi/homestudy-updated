# What is the Internet?

Updated: 04/26/2017 by Computer Hope

Alternatively referred to as the **net** or **web**, the **Internet** was initially developed to aid in the progress of computing technology by linking all the best academic computer centers. The Internet as we know it today first started being developed in the late 1960's and transmitted its first message on Friday, October 29, [1969][1]. In [1993][2], the Internet experienced one of its largest growths to date and today is accessible by people all over the world.

Tip: See our [Internet history][3] section for full information about the development and creation of the Internet.

![Map of the Internet][4]The Internet contains billions of web pages created by people and companies from around the world, making it a limitless place to locate information and entertainment. The Internet also has thousands of services that help make life more convenient. For example, many financial institutions offer online banking that enables a user to manage and view their account online. The picture is a representation and map of the Internet done by [The Opte Project][5].

## The Internet basics

* The Internet and the [WWW][6] are not the same thing.
* The Internet utilizes the [TCP/IP][7] [protocol][8] and is accessed using a computer [modem][9], [broadband][10], [3G][11], [4G][12], or network that is connected through an [ISP][13].
* In the case of broadband, many computers and devices use [Wi-Fi][14] to connect to [router][15] that is connected to the ISP.
* The Internet is explored, which is more commonly referred to as [surfing][16], using a [browser][17].
* Finding information on the Internet is achieved by using a [search engine][18].
* Users browse [web pages][19] by following [hyperlinks][20].
* Files, pictures, songs, and video can be shared [downloading][21] (receiving) and [uploading][22] (sending).
* The Internet is also used for communicating with others through [social networks][23], online games, [forums][24], [chat][25], [e-mails][26], [IM][27] and [VoIP][28].

## Why is the Internet considered a network?

The Internet is the world's largest network because it is a collections of [computers][29] and [servers][30] that are connected to each other using [routers][15] and [switches][31] around the world. The Internet works the same way a network would in a home or office just with millions of more computers and other routers and switches.
