Aspiring Andelans understand what an algorithm is and how to implement algorithms in Python. They determine and analyze which algorithm is the most efficient for a particular problem using the big O notation.

----------

### **Demonstrating knowledge of algorithms **
A. **  When given an algorithmic problem **
- I figure out the most efficient algorithm to use
- I implement the most efficient algorithm

B. **  When building an algorithm **
-  I consider efficiency and calculate the big O of the algorithm

----------

### **What do I need to believe about data structures:?**
1. Efficiency of a program is determined by the algorithm being used
2. Time spent making algorithms more efficient is never wasted
