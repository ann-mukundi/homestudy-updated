Aspiring Andelans know what tests are, how to write them, and how the TDD approach can be beneficial in development. They also understand the basics of debugging, including how to replicate a problem and gradually break down the process into simpler components to isolate the root cause of the defect.

### ** Demonstrating Skill **
A. **  When I am creating new functionality **
- I define my test before I write my code

B. **  When building out any application using the TDD approach  **
- I write tests, let them fail, before adding in code to make the tests pass

C. **  When building an application **
- I strive for 100% test coverage

D. **  When writing test cases **
- I identify all the possible edge cases and write tests for each of these cases

### ** What do I need to believe about test driven development:? **
1. TDD can help me attain 100% test coverage
2. Writing tests reduces the risk of my program malfunctioning in the future
3. Writing tests help me better define the specifications of an application I am building
4. My application will be more stable if I have solid test coverage
5. Following TDD practice will make me a better programmer
