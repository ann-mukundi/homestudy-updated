### ** Demonstrating Skill **
A. **  When I am creating new functionality **
- I define my test before I write my code

B. **  When building out any application using the TDD approach  **
- I write tests, let them fail, before adding in code to make the tests pass

C. **  When building an application **
- I strive for 100% test coverage

D. **  When writing test cases **
- I identify all the possible edge cases and write tests for each of these cases

### ** What do I need to believe about test driven development:? **
1. TDD can help me attain 100% test coverage
2. Writing tests reduces the risk of my program malfunctioning in the future
3. Writing tests help me better define the specifications of an application I am building
4. My application will be more stable if I have solid test coverage
5. Following TDD practice will make me a better programmer
